# Project

Personal Finance Tracker: In this project, students will build a personal finance advisor that helps users track basic financial habits and gives simple advice. The tracker will: 
✅ Collect info like monthly income, savings, and spending in key categories (e.g., entertainment, food).
✅ Give personalized financial advice (e.g., "You're spending 40% of your income on entertainment. Consider reducing it to 20%.").
✅ Use conditionals to warn users about overspending, suggest saving goals, or recommend budgeting strategies. 
✅ Include simple loops to allow users to review or update their data (e.g., "Would you like to enter another month’s info?"). 
✅ Use ChatGPT API to deliver a motivational money-saving tip or quote based on the user's habits.
